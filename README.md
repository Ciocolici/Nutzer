# Nutzer
A C# (CSharp) Console App project. The program allows the user to add, save and load users in and from XML file. It is my first try saving data into an XML file.

In "bin/Release/net6.0", is the XML file ("nutzerListe.xml" / users list) located.

Open "Nutzer.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Nutzer.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0".

Note: german language used.
